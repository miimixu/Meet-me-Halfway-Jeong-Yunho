# Meet-me-Halfway-Jeong-Yunho
hey im here with a one-shot imagine, i would write anything. but i decided to jump out of my comfort zone and write an imagine for any fellow atiny here. hope you enjoy!


  "You idiot! how could you tell him!?" Y/n slightly raised her voice at her friend. "Don't over-react Y/n it's fine-", "Fine Wooyoung? FINE!? out of all people I trust you not to tell my crush I like him and you tell him anyway!". Young raised his hands in defense, "it slipped out!" "Jung don't lie to me-" the bell rung. Y/n sighed and grabbed her things walking out of there not being able to finish her arguement.

  She knew it was probably just an accident, but she still couldn't process it. Her long time crush, who probably didn't even know her name, knew that she liked him. How embarrassing for her. 'I need to chill' she thought to herself. She went up to the rooftop. There she saw seven guys, and her crush; Jeong Yun Ho, yes the Jeong Yunho. ever teenage girl's dream right?
  
  'Crap' she thought. Y/n only was then realizing she was just standing there, phone and book in hand clutched to her chest and facing the so called "Ateez". Then she saw Wooyoung join them. Being zoned out for so made her muscles relax, there for the books and her phone slipped out of her hand. Y/n, had heard a crack.
  
  "no-" she has mumbled and bent down to grab her phone but was to nervous to even go down. It was at this moment she looked up and saw the guys look at her. "uh-" The tensed up Y/n stood up and turned around without her things. She heard some footsteps behind her.
  
  "You could have forgotten your things." 
  
  *silence*
  
  She slowly turned around, facing a tall Yunho towering over her. "Your things." he handed her the books and she grabbed them. Then she reached for her phone. "I got it." Yunho grabbed it first, now handing her now cracked phone over to her.
  
  "t-thanks.." she stuttered taking it. 'god Y/n get a grip speak not stumble' she thought to herself. "Thank. you." she said in the same cold tone, sounding mockingly as he raised a brow. Yunho responded in that same way she did "you. are. welcome." 'dont freak out. dont freak out. dont. dont. dont.' she told herself repeatetly. 
  
  *timeskip*
 
  Y/n entered her job as a barista at a new cafe that her aunt owned. It was smackdab in the middle of the city where a plaza was placed at, so the newly 18 year old knew there would be many visitors. And many visitors mean better paycheck, and better paycheck means her saving for college. Pretty smart of her to choose that new cafe right? Of course... but today she wasnt working the counter... more of her.. guitar? If you want to put it that way.
  
  Her overgrown bangs kept getting in her way covering her eyes as she walked, and eventually she accepted it. Y/n felt indecisive, about whether she should let them grow or trim them, so for now they were staying undereye length. She didn't mind by now though.
  
  Walking into the cafe Y/n had went straight to the stage after greeting her co-workers and put her things down. She knew she was new to this scene, performing was not her thing at all. in fact stage freight was her best friend right now. "*sighs* Lets roll" she mumbled to herself sitting on a stool. As soon as everything stettled and she started singing a familiar figure walked into the cafe..
  
PART ONE OF TWO- TO BE CONTINUED....
