  "You idiot! how could you tell him!?" You slightly raised your voice at your friend. "Don't over-react Y/n it's fine-", "Fine Wooyoung? FINE!? out of all people I trust you not to tell my crush I like him and you tell him anyway!". Young raised his hands in defense, "it slipped out!" "Jung don't lie to me-" the bell rung. You just sighed and grabbed your things walking out of there not being able to finish your arguement.

  But you knew it was probably just an accident, but you were pissed, nervous, and still couldn't process it. A long time crush, who probably didn't even know your name, knew that you had liked him. How embarrassing for you Y/n. 'I need to chill' you had thought to yourself. You decided to go up to the rooftop. There you just saw seven guys, and your crush; Jeong Yun Ho, yes the Jeong Yunho. every teenage girl's dream right?
  
  'Crap' you thought. You were only then realizing she was just standing there, phone and book in hand clutched to her chest and facing the so called "Ateez". Then you just had to see Wooyoung join them. Being zoned out for so made her muscles relax, there for the books and her phone slipped out of her hand. Y/n, had heard a crack.
  
  "no-" you mumbled and bent down to grab her phone but was to nervous to even go down. It was at this moment you looked up and saw the guys look straight at you. "uh-" Tensed up, you stood up and turned around without your things. then you heard some footsteps behind you.
  
  "You could have forgotten your things." 
  
  *silence*
  
  You didn't feel the need to, but you slowly turned around, now facing a tall Yunho towering over you. "Your things." he handed you your the books and you grabbed them. Then you had reached for your phone. "I got it." Yunho grabbed it first, now handing your now cracked phone over to you.
  
  "t-thanks.." you had stuttered taking it. 'god Y/n get a grip speak not stumble' you thought to yourself. "Thank. you." you said in the same cold tone, sounding mockingly as he raised a brow. Yunho responded in that same way you previously did "you. are. welcome." 'dont freak out. dont freak out. dont. dont. dont.' you told yourself repeatetly as he just smirked as your now flustered state.
  
  *timeskip*
 
  You entered your new- new ish job as a barista at a new cafe that your aunt owned. It was smackdab in the middle of the city where a plaza was placed at, so newly 18 year old you knew there would be many visitors. And many visitors mean better paycheck, and better paycheck means your saving for college. Pretty smart of you to choose that new cafe right? Of course... but today you weren't working the counter... more of your.. guitar? If you want to put it that way.
  y
  Your overgrown bangs kept getting in your way covering your eyes as you walked, and eventually you accepted it. You, Y/n felt indecisive, about whether you should  either let them grow or trim them, so for now they were staying undereye length. We don't think you would mind by now though.
  
  Walking into the cafe you had went straight to the stage after greeting your co-workers and put your things down. You knew you're new to this scene, performing was not your thing at all. In fact stage freight was your best friend right now. "*sighs* Lets roll" you mumbled to yourself sitting on a stool. As soon as everything stettled and you started singing a familiar figure walked into the cafe. You just locked eye contact with that person for a while not realizing who it really was.
  
  After your shift as today you were just singing, you walked out the plaza, the night stars filling the sky. Right by the plaza, an alleyway, the same one you had used for years to get home. You never really minded it though, you had always brushed off the thought of getting kidnapped or murdered. Not really a thing of your thoughts. You could hold your own... ok just sometimes though. Not after you heard fighting, not wanting to get in the conflict yourself. 
  
  "you're gonna regret that"
  
  You heard that same voice you did at school, and you knew exactly who it was. You tensed up realizing Yunho might be involved in the fight, and after the attitude you put on with him earlier, you thought it wouldn't go well. Y/n you really tried to just walk by them but you seconds later felt someone grab your collar from behind. You turned around and faced Wooyoung, who's red eyes was staring directly into your eyes...
